## Biography

I was born in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, in 1998, and my academic journey led me to graduate with a Bachelor of Technology in Biomedical Engineering in April 2020. During my undergraduate studies, I undertook a thesis project that focused on the design of an energy harvesting system utilizing piezoelectric sensors embedded in shoes, aimed at monitoring the performance of athletes and sports enthusiasts.

## Teaching Experience

Following my graduation, I had the opportunity to lead medical coding training sessions, specifically in the field of "Human Anatomy and Physiology," with Amra Healthcare at Sri Kailash Women's College. This experience allowed me to share my knowledge and contribute to the education of future healthcare professionals.

## Entrepreneurship

In 2021, I took a significant step in my career by founding "Bio Medcare Solutions," a business dedicated to the biomedical field. Within Bio Medcare Solutions, we specialize in supplying medical equipment and accessories, as well as providing essential services to healthcare facilities. This entrepreneurial endeavor has allowed me to further immerse myself in the core aspects of the healthcare industry.

## Ongoing Pursuits

Currently, I am pursuing a Master's degree in Biomedical Engineering at Università Politecnica delle Marche in Ancona, Italy.

## Certification

To ensure the highest quality in the medical devices and services we provide, I completed the Certification in internal auditing for quality management systems, specifically for medical devices, in accordance with ISO 13485:2016 standards. This certification reflects my commitment to maintaining the highest standards in the biomedical industry.
